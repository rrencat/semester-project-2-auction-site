## Goal

To take the skills learned over the past three semesters and create an auction website.

<i>An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.
When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings.</i>

## Description

Using provided NorOff API and API documentation, I have been tasked to create a website for an auction house which allows registered users to view, add and bid on different items. And to allow non-registered users to view the items currently up for auction.

JWT was used to get access token which then was stored in local storage.

Javascript functions description was made using JSDocs.
